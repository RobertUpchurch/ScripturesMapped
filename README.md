## What I Learned

1. During this project I learned alot of things. Some of the main things that I learned is the onHashChange, this was a really cool way to navigate around with javascript without having to reload the page. It made the site very fluid and feel good.

2. I also learned alot about good coding practices, I kept my code clean, alphebatized, and intentional.

3. I Found that JSLint can be extremely helpful although it can also be extremely picky. Many times I was able to fix bugs before going to run it just from passing things into JSLint

4. Integrating with 3rd party API's can be easy and make your ap incredibly good.

## What I accomplished

I was able to accomplish a working application that does everything that the requirement asked for. I feel like I made a great tool that can truly help my scripture study. However, since this tool already exists in an identical form, I learned that If I can acquire the data I could make similar tools that would be just as useful for other subjects. 

I feel like I accomplished a very good working product that is worth while to show on my personal portfolio.
