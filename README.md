During the first 2 videos of doing project 1 I learned 3 main new things. One it finally clicked why it is so important that we try to declare our private methods first before we create them. Theat scoping finally made sense and I was able to understand how to avoid erors with scoping. The second thing that I learned is how to chain call backs effectively so that it is handled at the end of the chain. Javascript being asynchronous makes it difficult at times but this call back structure made alot of sense. The last thing I grasped well is the idea of loading multiple data arrays from a backend and then handling some of the manipulation from the front end. All in all I am very excited about continuing with this project.
